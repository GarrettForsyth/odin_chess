    # /seeks. 
    #
    # JS webdrivers seem to be configured fine with Capybara.
    #
    # After much experimenting, I found that commenting out the
    # command calling ActionCable.server.broadcast in the SeeksController
    # prevents the redirect and page  navigation behaves as expected, however
    # of course the page is not updated. 
    #
    # Until i figure this out, I'll just use this hack of revisiting the page
    visit lobby_path
    # expect(current_path).to eq(lobby_path)
